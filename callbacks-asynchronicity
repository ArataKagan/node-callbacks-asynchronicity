1. What is the difference between readdirSync and readdir?

readdirSync : synchronously read the name of files and it blocks execusion. 
readdir : asynchronously read the file names and it's non-blocking.  

2. What is the event loop and how does it handle asynchronous requests? 

Event loop is a mechanism which allows a asynchronous task to wait until it's ready to execute. 
For example, when executing a file using fs.readFile, the task is assigned to event queue. 
The task goes into the event loop and the file gets executed when it's ready. 


3. Given the following code, specify whether the program is asynchronous 
and non-blocking or synchronous and blocking or synchronous and non-blocking. 

synchronous and blocking 

4. Given the following code, specify whether the program is asynchronous 
and non-blocking or synchronous and blocking or synchronous and non-blocking.

asynchronous and non-blocking 

5. In what order will the console.log statements execute in the code below?

"C" , "A" , "B" 

6. setTimeout is a JavaScript function which calls a function after 
a set amount of milliseconds. Given the following code, 
explain in what sequence the functions will run and why. 

"hello" , "friend"  

Although greeting function is evoked first, it takes 1000 milliseconds to console log the 
text. Therefore, function hello is executed first. 

7. Create a function which utilizes a callback. 
Make sure to add console.log statements to understand when your callback function is called. 

function alertToDo(phrase, callback){
	alert(`Please remind me ${phrase}`);
	callback();
} 

alertToDo('buying ingredients for dinner', function(){
    console.log('execusion finished');
});
